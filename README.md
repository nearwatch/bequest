# Bequest
The service is intended for situations where you need to insure against loss of access to cryptocurrency funds due to death, illness, imprisonment, loss of keys.

The way the service works is simple: a special insurance account is created, all keys of the owner account are copied, a contract is established with the registered heir accounts, as well as an activation period in case of inactivity of the owner.

The owner periodically click a button in the Telegram WebApp, calling the contract method, which resets the time counter and only the owner has access to the account.

If there was no activity of the owner for more than the activation period, then heir accounts have the opportunity to add their key to the insurance account and gain access to it.
